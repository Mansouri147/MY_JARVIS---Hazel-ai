This is Hazel the new version of MY_JARVIS it has a lot of funny and cool features that you can try 
i'm about to add some Epic new features but it works well right now you can try it and have fun!

If you're a very beginner follow these steps if not just ignore 'em:
    -First step it's quite obvious that you may have python installed in your device.
    -Second install everything written in requirements in your terminal or just in your 
    cmd type in :
        python 
        pip install (type in here first line)
        pip install (type in here second line)...
    -and... Enjoy!

NOTE: the pypl version of pyttsx3 is not working for me and i think it's damaged maybe so i uploaded the right one in here, it's quite easy to change it or put it in place just download then 
paste it in a folder named "lib/site packages" located somewhere in your project venv or in your python directory
itself or maybe in your anaconda appdata directory if you are using anaconda.
-if you still can't find it just pip install pyttsx then in search box search for pyttsx and replace it.
